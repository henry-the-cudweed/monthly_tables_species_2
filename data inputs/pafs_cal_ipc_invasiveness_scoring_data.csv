The seeds in Southern California are readily moving downstream to new habitats, as evidenced by the establishment of numerous small garlic mustard patches (C. McDonald pers. obv., Calflora 2022). The only two known naturalized populations of garlic mustard are hundred of miles apart and themselves isolated by hundreds of miles to the next wild out-of-state populations in Oregon and Utah (iNaturalist). Most seeds fall close to the parent plant (Anderson 2012). Since the fruits are 3-5 feet high the seeds are easily picked up on equipment, the clothes of hikers, and, possibly, wildlife.","Anderson, 2012. Rodgers et al., 2008b. C. McDonald pers. obv.

In Carlsbad, this plant was located on a southern-facing slope growing among open Diegan coastal sage scrub dominated by California sage (Artemisia californica).  Associates included coast sunflower (Encelia californica), buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum), lemonade berry (Rhus integrifolia), and tocalote (Centaurea melitensis).  C. annua was growing on open clay lenses in the coastal sage scrub and underneath the shrubs.

First official record was in 1950; this species was collected at the Kramer Ranch in Big Valley, Lassen County by Loring White and identified by J.T. Howell of the Academy of Sciences, and subsequently identified by Dr. S.F. Blake of the USDA.  Prior to 1910 there is no information about this ranch on which the sample was collected.  After 1910 records indicate that the ranch was rented out as sheep pasture and under lease to neighboring rancher, James Summers.  This site was then used as an overnight campground by sheepmen when they trailed their bands of sheep from the Sacramento Valley to higher ranges in the summer and returned them in the fall.  In 1935 Mr. Summers reported to have commented on a weed taking over his leased pasture.  About 1944 Mr. Rupert Lyons purchased the property and found a heavy infestation of the weed.  Mr Lyons sold the land to Mr. O.E. Brown, whose son collected the specimen identified in 1950.

Restricts light availability for species under the canopy. Hill et al. (2001) report that, ""Vines can climb the tallest forest trees, forming a dense, light-absorbing canopy that suppresses all vegetation beneath it. C. vitalba can be so vigorous that the weight of foliage and stems breaks the supporting trees, reducing once-healthy forest to a low, long-lived thicket of vines scrambling over stumps and logs"". However Ogle et al. (2000) observe that the vines ascend to the canopy of forest but are unable to climb large diameter emergent trees unless shrubs and smaller trees provide a series of stepping stones to the crown of tall trees. Their study findings (study area Taihape reserve, New Zealand) indicate that the numbers and variety of understorey trees and shrubs that have been severely reduced following the infestation of C. vitalba correlates with observations of the growth habit of C. vitalba. Ogle et al. showed e.g. that not a single canopy tree species had been lost from the Taihape Reserves though 25% or so of the understorey trees and shrubs species had been lost.","GISD 2005

Forms dense, smothering blanket over trees. Loss of forest structure and biodiversity at ecosystem and species levels, loss of recruitment of native shrubs in New Zealand. Dense, smothering cover can block movement through trees. 

It is invasive because it forms a dense smothering blanket over native trees, impeding their growth and increasing wind and ice damage. The vine rapidly climbs into the crown by its leaf tendrils. It invades forests from the edge or in canopy gaps, alters their structure and reduces the diversity of native understory species (Weber 2003).","Bungard 1996

In Santa Cruz County C. vitalba is thought to have been introduced in the town of San Vicente which was located in the San Vicente Creek watershed. This historic town was established for workers at a nearby limestone quarry and is now uninhabited (Hamey, pers. comm.).

C. vitalba is able to establish in areas with natural or human-caused disturbance, but is not known to establish in undisturbed natural areas. C. vitalba requires high light for growth and reproduction, and is tolerant of moderate shade. In seedling germination studies done in forests, C. vitalba seedlings did not survive in undisturbed forests with low light levels. It was also found that nitrogen may be the limiting nutrient resource (Bungard et al. 1998). C. vitalba is a successful weed because it can tolerate dense shade but also has the ability to grow rapidly in high-light environments, meaning it can establish in areas with very small forest canopy gaps (Baars and Kelly 1996).","Baars and Kelly 1996

","Dumping of garden waste containing C. vitalba vines onto roadsides has been a significant cause of spread in New Zealand. This weed appears to invade along roadsides by seed, possibly aided by the turbulence created by motor vehicles (CABI). 
Fragments are spread by water, and from garden cuttings (Washington 1999). 

C. vitalba often grows on roadsides, and the risk of seeds being transported on road vehicles from known infestations to new sites within continents is high. In the past, ornamental Clematis species were often grafted onto C. vitalba rootstocks. It is likely that some incursions of C. vitalba have resulted from reversion of these rootstocks. The highest risk of introduction remains via intentional introduction of the plant as an ornamental, and plants and seed continue to be sold by nurseries, mail order catalogues and websites (CABI). In Santa Cruz County C. vitalba is thought to have been introduced in the town of San Vicente which was located in the San Vicente Creek watershed. This historic town was established for workers at a nearby limestone quarry and is now uninhabited (Hamey, pers. comm.).

There has been no known management in the introduction area since 2014 and the natural resources managers of Delta Meadows State Park reports that it has been observed to spread less than a mile upstream, and the population is expanding enough to be considered doubling in 10 years (Beard, D. and Allen, C. personal communications). After the first detection at Delta Meadows, populations were reported in San Joaquin, Solano and Orange counties, so it is assumed that the plant will be spreading and found elsewhere over time.","Calflora 2016

Natural breeding and population spread have been reported for wild taro. Cultivars are propagated through the use of corms, cormels (also known as suckers), while vegetative propagation occurs through stolons in the wild. According to Weber (2003), naturalized plants rarely produce seeds and only in hot, tropical climates.","Chair 2016
Weber 2003","Dispersed primarily by purposeful or accidental movement of vegetative fragments. Only a portion of corm crown and petiole are needed to establish a new plant.

Moore and Lawrence 2003",Rhizome fragments are carried by streams. Grows mostly next to rivers so there is high potential for long-distance dispersal. Floods can dislodge bud-laden rhizomes from the banks. Growth seems to be best in the silty soils lining the river-banks.,"Langeland and Burks 2008
Weber 2003","C. esculenta is native to Australia, India, and southeastern Asia. It is naturalized in Florida, New Zealand, West Indies, southern Europe, and the Canary Islands, mainly in tropical climates. It can be found growing mainly in moist forests and wet areas in riparian habitats, riverbanks, along streams, marshes, and canals. It can also be found in secondary forests, roadsides, and disturbed areas near to abandoned crop fields. It has invaded some of these habitat types in California, but is not yet found in woodlands or riparian habitats away from the immediate water's edge, and has not yet spread widely.","Langeland and Burks 2008

The exact introduction date is unknown, but the species has been grown as a crop in California in past years (Molinar and Yang 2001, Moore and Lawrence 2003). A specimen was collected from Delta Meadows State Park in 2014, located near Isleton in Sacramento County. Plants were growing along the edge of the river and in The Meadows Slough mixed with other riparian vegetation, including the State-listed Rare California hibiscus (Hibiscus lasiocarpus var. occidentalis). Further mapping in the area identified it as occurring in 7 patches in the Park as well as upstream and downstream from the Park boundary in two places (Robison 2014).  Other reports were submitted to Calflora for locations in Solano, San Joaquin and Orange counties (Calflora 2016). The locations in Solano and San Joaquin counties are on river edges, the Orange County habitat is unknown, but appears to be a wetland edge from the aerial photograph.","CCH 2014

Brenzel, K. 2001. The Sunset Western Garden Book.ed. Sunset Publishing Corporation, Menlo Park, CA.","Cotoneaster can quickly come to dominate a scrub or grassland area on sandy or clay soils, and even on serpentine soils and extirpate native species. In many areas of coastal California the Cotoneaster, at 3m tall, will be the tallest plant and shade out native scrub and grasses; in forested areas Cotoneaster seedlings will compete with seedlings from native trees. The Cotoneaster grows quickly in comparison to native scrubs, has a large root system that can extend beyond the canopy of a smaller Cotoneaster, and produces berries that are very popular with birds who spread the seeds. Additionally, the Cotoneasters are highly adaptable and can grow in moist (near waterways) or dry soils, and even in the thin, rocky soils underlying native grasslands. California's grasslands have been severely reduced by the proliferation of non-native annual grasses and are especially difficult to restore. Cotoneaster are able to grow in grasslands, shade out nativegrasses, and create areas with higher organic matter and moisture that favor weedy grasses.",Sigg 2000,"Reduces habitat for burrowing rodents such as voles and shrews, reduces habitat for bird species such as quail that require open grassy areas for seed foraging, reduces space in which raptors can hunt. Reducing habitat for rodents and some birds will in turn reduce food source for raptors, foxes, coyotes and other carnivores. Coastal areas of california are defined by areas of scrub and oak interspered with open areas in which grasses and annual forbs persist.  This pattern is constantly changing depending on erosion, rainfall, and natural progression from open sand into scrub and eventually oak woodland.  However, Cotoneaster grows and spreads much more quickly than native plants.  It fills in open areas in scrub and covers grasslands when not rigorously controlled.  Its dense roots and branches can effectively close off the area under its canopy making it inhospitable to rodents and difficult for larger birds to penetrate.  In Australian bushland cotoneaster has provided food for birds such as the currawong that would normally migrate, but as berries run out during the winter the currawong begins to prey on small songbirds. I don't know of any migratory birds that come through California that may eat songbirds, but it is something to think about.","Observation, C. Christman.

The Jepson Manual. University of California Press. Berkeley, CA.","Cotoneaster can invade wildlands without any dramatic anthropogenic or natural disturbance. I have observed Cotoneaster growing in undisturbed scrubland, grassland and forested areas. Because birds eat the berries and drop the seed in scat, disturbance is not necessary for the spread of the seed. Additionally, Cotoneaster are well-adapted to many soil types and can do well in full sun or aprt shade conditions. It is likely that the fragmentation of wildlands has been at least partly responsible for this spread, Cotoneasters are a popular horticultural plant (in part because they attract birds!) and they are often cultivated close to wild areas. It has been noted by Jake Sigg that the oldest Cotoneasters seen in the wild are only 15 to 20 years old and that a change in genotype mighy have allowed Cotoneasters to spread more rapidly in the recent past as they have been cultivated in California since 1854.","C.

Artichoke thistle is a threat to the endangered San Diego thornmint.  Usually displaces annual exotic grasses, which may be facilitated by fire.  Seriously threatens grassland ecosystems and may affect coastal sage scrub and riparian habitat in southern California.  In San Diego's Los Penasquitos Canyon, artichoke thistle invades open forb covered canyon bottomlands.  It can also invade riparian woodlands under willow (Salix spp.), mulefat (Baccharis glutinosa) and sycamore (Platanus racemosa). Artichoke thistle can reach stands of 22,000 plants per acre. Forms a basal rosette of leaves up to six feet in diameter.  Reduces available habitat for grassland dependent species; displaces natives.  There may be some alleopathic mechanism to neighbor plant suppression.  When leaves die and fall to the ground they do not readily decompose, thus providing another barrier to competing species.","Kelly, M. Cynara cardunculus.

UC Press, Berkeley;","Spread appeared to be rapid from the late 1800's into the 1930s.  Control efforts in northern California (Benecia) have stabilized and even reduced its spread.  Most artichoke thistle seeds (achenes) fall very near the parent plant and can disperse 70 feet by wind when attached to a pappus.  Seeds can spread further with water, mud, soil movement, animals and human activities.  Dispersal by root fragments is important only following mechanical disturbance.  Seedlings appear to survive best when adult rosettes are removed but seedling emergence is not influenced by prescence or absence of adult rosettes. The seeds (achenes) are relatively large (6-8 mm long) so will typically not disperse far from the mother plant.  A feathery pappus (25-40 mm long) is attached to the seeds while in the flower, which can facilitate long distance dispersal by wind.  However, the pappus usually breaks off soon after exiting the flower.","Thomsen, C.D. , G. Barbe, W. Williams, and M. George.  1986.  Escaped artichokes are troublesome pests.

From the appearance of the infestation at the Coast Gallery it appears to me that E.candicans could be invasive.  The infestation occurs on a steep hillside and appears unlikely to have been intentionally planted.  Carolyn Martus, active CNPS/Cal-IPC member and WMA participant, reports that E.candicans is growing wild in San Diego County at the San Elijo Lagoon Ecological Reserve.

Pls with pink to pale blue corollas and nutlets sharply tubercled are called E. strictum L.f.  Pls 2-3 m with basal lf rosette and +- cylindric infl 1+ m are called E. pininana Webb &amp; Berth.""","Hickman, James C. The Jepson Manual. 1996","tolerant of poor soils and able to tolerate drought, once established
  Looking at pictures that I took, of a wildland infestation at the Coast Gallery on Highway 1 south of Big Sur, there are hundreds of Echium plants growing down a steep hill - an area that seems unlikely to have been intentionally planted or could have only have been intentionally planted by throwing seeds or propagative parts down the cliff bank.  There are small plants seen in the pictures.  I've also noticed individual plants growing on the roadsides of Highway 154 in Santa Barbara County away from garden areas, but I cannot be certain whether these plants are garden escapes or garden remnants.
However, Dieter Wilken stated on 7/28/04, in an email to me, "" Its been over 10 years since I did the treatment of those taxa for the Jepson Manual, and I had a lot of assistance from Elizabeth McClintock at the time.  The two species, as I recall, are found primarily in the bay area.  I find it hard to believe that Echium candicans would be considered invasive _ its largely an urban weed along the coast, and then only in a few localities (at least in the early 1990s).  As far as I know, Echium does not have a highly dispersable fruit.  Plants persist for many decades.  Its possible that someone planted at least one plant there many years ago, and it has slowly expanded at the site.  One sees young plants or seedlings only very rarely.  Elizabeth McClintock took me to a population on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay that had several hundred plants. I recall her saying that they had persisted there since the late 1940s but that there was hardly any recruitment (i.e. small plants with few branches).  Once established, however, the plants seem to survive even the harshest droughts.  However, a deep frost usually kills them _ one reason why they are found only along the coast in California."" 
I also found mentions of pride of Madeira naturalizing or occuring in natural areas in California on two websites - www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/quarry.html and forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/calif/msg0723003323285.html.

Ratings do not determine the overall value of particular plants in particular places, and the term &amp;ldquo;invasive&amp;rdquo; should not be construed as a universal condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eucalyptus globulus&lt;/em&gt;, Tasmanian blue gum, was last assessed by Cal-IPC in 2006 as part of a major initiative to update and document assessments for some 200 plant species. In 2014, Cal-IPC reassessed E. globulus. This new assessment revises scores for some criteria and results in a change in overall score from &amp;ldquo;Moderate&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Limited.&amp;rdquo; To large degree this change is due to evaluating&lt;em&gt; E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; across the entire state, rather than focusing on coastal areas where it is most prone to spreading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue gum eucalyptus is unique among naturalized non-native plant species in California. Its rich cultural history is documented in detail by Jared Farmer in &lt;em&gt;Trees in Paradise: A California History&lt;/em&gt; (Norton, 2013). While most plants listed by Cal-IPC have spread into wildlands on their own, blue gum was actively planted in natural areas for timber, windbreaks and aesthetics. The stands existing today are those that were planted in an earlier time. &lt;em&gt;E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; were most typically planted in grasslands, yet their most logical native analog habitat is oak or bay laurel woodland; this assessment aims to assess the most relevant comparison for each criterion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some stands were planted so densely that few other plants grow within the stand, while less dense stands often contain more plant diversity. Some stands are regenerating and expanding in size, while others in less favorable conditions are not. Some stands are within areas now being managed primarily for ecological values, others are not. Where stands do occur in areas being managed for ecological values, it makes clear sense to assess their ecological impact as an invasive plant. Plantations that are not regenerating or expanding are not considered &amp;ldquo;invasive&amp;rdquo; in the customary use of the term. Management decisions for stands in urban areas will necessarily involve consideration of a range of factors, such as recreational and aesthetic values and the trees&amp;rsquo; much-debated role in wildfire risk. For these stands, the information provided in this assessment can help assess impacts on native habitat, which may also be a factor in management decisions.&lt;/p&gt;",B,Reviewed Scientific Publication,B,Reviewed Scientific Publication,B,Reviewed Scientific Publication,D,Other Published Material,C,Other Published Material,B,Reviewed Scientific Publication,C,Observational,C,Other Published Material,C,Observational,C,Reviewed Scientific Publication,C,Other Published Material,A,Observational,C,Observational,Array,Array,B,3,Limited,,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; alters fire regime and groundwater availability. (Potential for allelopathy was examined but is not included.) These impacts can be significant in circumstances where blue gum were planted at high density and growing conditions are favorable for the species, and less significant in other places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alteration of fire regime:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparing wildfire parameters in blue gum stands versus native oak woodland (a comparable native habitat structure) fuel loads are significantly greater. E. globulus stands can accumulate significantly higher fuel loads than native woodlands. One study found fuel loads of 31 tons/acre in E. globulus stands as compared to 19 tons/acre in California bay forest and 12 tons/acre in coast live oak woodlands (National Park Service 2006). (Factors of ignition and relative flammability are not considered here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wildfire in grasslands is typically more frequent and less intense than wildfire in heavily wooded areas (whether native or non-native). Higher fire intensity can impact soils as well as seed mortality in the soil seed bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alteration of groundwater availability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high water consumption of E. globulus is well known (Rejmanek &amp;amp; Richardson 2011) and eucalyptus species have been used by development agencies to drain swampy areas in efforts to reduce malaria (see for instance the Wikipedia entry for Eucalyptus). E. globulus and E. camuldensis (red gum) are used in environmental remediation projects. An example of this is PG&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s 30 acre plantation in Lake County, California. At that site the trees are used to provide hydraulic control of groundwater beneath a landfill. The object of this remediation is to suppress groundwater and keep it from contacting geothermal wastes placed in the landfill (Deutsch 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lateral roots can extend 30 m or more from the trunk, and in deep soils with high water tables, roots can penetrate to depths of 14 m (DiTomaso &amp;amp; Healy 2007). According to DiTomaso &amp;amp; Healy (2007) E. globulus are able to withstand prolonged dry summers by tapping into deep water reservoirs as well as by economizing water use through stomatal control. Their far-reaching root systems can extract water from the soil at even higher soil moisture tensions than most mesophytic plants (Pryor 1976, Florence 1996). The National Park Service is beginning to study groundwater response to eucalyptus removal, for instance on the Channel Islands (Power 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In coastal zones, fog drip under blue gum stands can be substantial, which accounts for the ability of coastal stands to regenerate (Yost 2014). A study in San Francisco found fog drip from eucalyptus drip can add as much as 42 cm of water during a single summer (Clarke et. al. 2008). This amount is comparable to annual rainfall and in such areas fog drip may significantly mitigate groundwater consumption.&lt;/p&gt;",&lt;p&gt;See references within text.&lt;/p&gt;,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; stands displace native plant communities. Plant communities can be severely altered in circumstances where blue gum was planted at high density and growing conditions are favorable. Plant communities in other places can be significantly less impacted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditions are most favorable for blue gum growth and regeneration along the coast in northern and central California (Ritter and Yost 2012). Capacity for regeneration is based on environmental conditions; areas with reliable year-round moisture, such as along riparian corridors and along the coast from Monterey Bay north where summer fog drip provides seedlings with some moisture, are most likely to support naturally reproducing eucalyptus populations (Yost 2014). Juvenile foliage is seldom browsed by livestock or wildlife, aiding seedling survival (Skolmen and Ledig 1990).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; stands can form near monocultures in areas where they were planted at high densities (Griffiths &amp;amp; Villablanca 2013). On Angel Island in San Francisco Bay, native trees were only found in eucalyptus plantings where the blue gums had been widely spaced, and these natives were &amp;ldquo;not vigorous&amp;rdquo; (McBride, Sugihara, and Amme 1988).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reports of plant diversity within &lt;em&gt;E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; stands vary, reflecting the range of conditions, including original planting density, suitability of the microclimate for eucalyptus growth and regeneration, composition of native seed bank, size of the stand and diversity of the surrounding vegetation. Some studies report depauperate plant communities (Esser 1993, DiTomaso &amp;amp; Healy 2007, Bean &amp;amp; Russo 2014) limited by shading and a thick litter layer, while other studies report some native plant species being supported in the understory (LSA Associates 2009, San Francisco Recreation and Park Department 2006).&lt;/p&gt;",&lt;p&gt;See references within text.&lt;/p&gt;,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E. globulus&lt;/strong&gt; alters habitat for birds. Effects on terrestrial vertebrates and arthropods were reviewed but are not included in this assessment. Some blue gum stands provide habitat for monarch butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impacts to birds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the breeding bird species that are most representative of oak and riparian habitats make little or no use of eucalyptus. Decay-resistant wood offers limited nesting opportunities for woodpeckers and birds that excavate their own holes. Birds that glean insects from foliage are also present at notably lower densities than in native oak woodlands (Suddjian 2004, Williams 2002).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus stands do provide nesting habitat for large roosting birds such as herons, egrets, and cormorants and raptors such as red-shouldered and red-tailed hawks (Suddjian 2004, LSA Associates 2009). They also provide a nectar source for bees and hummingbirds (Rejmanek &amp;amp; Richardson 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the abundance and health of grassland and oak woodland near blue gum stands, these stands may be considered to be damaging or complementing native habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monarch butterfly habitat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some eucalyptus stands provide overwintering sites for Monarch butterflies, along with native trees such as coast redwoods, Monterey pine and Monterey cypress (Griffiths &amp;amp; Villablanca 2013).&lt;/p&gt;",&lt;p&gt;See references within text.&lt;/p&gt;,&lt;p&gt;No congeners native to the United States; no hybridization between non-native Eucalyptus spp. and native plant species in California.&lt;/p&gt;,"&lt;p&gt;Baldwin et al. 2012,&amp;nbsp;Calflora 2014&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; was introduced to California in 1856 (Esser 1993) and is now naturalized in parts of California (Esser 1993, Ritter &amp;amp; Yost 2009). Purposeful cultivation was the primary mode of establishment (Skolmen &amp;amp; Ledig 1990, Esser 1993, HEAR 2007, LSA Associates 2009, Baldwin et al. 2012). E. globulus was planted on about 40,000 acres in California, extending from Humboldt County in the north to San Diego County in the south, with best growth in the coastal fog belt (Skolmen &amp;amp; Ledig 1990).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New populations independent of planting are rarely seen in California. Spread is typically limited to expansion along the periphery of an existing population. While eucalyptus bears abundant seed, it does not generally find appropriate conditions for germination (Tyrell 1999). Seeds germinate best on bare mineral soil so germination within dense forests is difficult (Bean &amp;amp; Russo 2014).&lt;/p&gt;",&lt;p&gt;See references within text.&lt;/p&gt;,"&lt;p&gt;Though not all &lt;em&gt;E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; stands are expanding, those in moist coastal habitats often expand at a significant rate. New populations are rare; spread is almost entirely along the periphery of existing stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most naturalized stands of &lt;em&gt;E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; are present along the coast in northern and central California (Ritter &amp;amp; Yost 2012). Aerial photographs show a 50-400% increase in eucalyptus stand size between 1930 and 2001 across six sites in coastal California (Van Dyke 2004). On Angel Island, blue gum &amp;ldquo;invaded areas adjacent to all sites where it was originally planted,&amp;rdquo; resulting in an expansion from 24 acres to 86 acres, a 360% expansion, over a century (McBride, Sugihara and Amme 1988). Potential spread rate has been estimated at 10-20 feet per year under favorable conditions (Bean &amp;amp; Russo 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some studies show that this is not the case with all populations. An assessment of changes in cover over a 58-year period at three regional parks in the East Bay hills indicates a decline in eucalyptus cover at all three locations (Russell and McBride 2003), though it is unclear how management activities may have affected stand size in these locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;California State Parks personnel submitted the following recent reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim Hyland (2014) in the Santa Cruz District reports that nine coastal units have E. globulus patches that have moved into riparian, coastal prairie, and coastal scrub habitats. Two units have E. globulus patches that exist in forested settings and show no signs of reproduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vince Cincero (2014) in the San Luis Obispo Coast District referred to a 1990 report compiled by Susan Bicknell of Humboldt State University on eucalyptus at Montana de Oro State Park in Los Osos. The report describes an original plantation established in 1907/08, with the earliest aerial photos from 1949 showing 7 species of eucalyptus covering 119 acres. Forty years later in 1989, the grove had expanded 52% to 181 acres, of which E. globulus covered 108 acres (the original portion comprising blue gum is unknown).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suzanne Goode (2014) in the Angeles District reports that: at Mulholland Highway and Pacific Coast Highway, E. globulus is spreading upslope; at Nicholas Flats Natural Preserve, E. globulus (and possibly other eucalyptus species) are spreading from an original plantation homestead;and at the Will Rogers State Historic Park E. globulus continues to spread from plantings into the hillsides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michelle Forys (2014) in the North Coast Redwoods District reports that the few planted clumps of E. globulus located on district property are actively controlled to stop spread beyond the historical planted area. Additionally, she has observed a planting on the west side of along Highway 101 between Arcata and Eureka spreading across to the east side of the highway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;","&lt;p&gt;See references within text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Some stands of E. globulus along the California coast are regenerating and expanding, while others are stable or even shrinking. CalWeedMapper (2014) shows that E. globulus is thought (by local land managers) to be spreading in about 47% of the USGS quadrangles where it is present in the state, and stable in the rest (decreases are not documented in the system, other than through active management).&lt;/p&gt;",&lt;p&gt;See references within text.&lt;/p&gt;,"&lt;p style=""margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt;""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=""font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""&gt;1.

Germination rates are typically very low: a 1% germination rate is good, given the more usual 0.1% germination success rate (Bean &amp;amp; Russo 2014).

When stored, seeds can remain viable for several years, but in field conditions, viable seed banks are not expected to be maintained beyond a year (Rejmanek &amp;amp; Richardson 2011).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6. Viable seed produced with both self-pollination and cross-pollination: No&lt;span class=""apple-converted-space""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;When the cap covering the reproductive organs (the operculum) is shed, the anthers have mature pollen, but the stigma does not become receptive until some days later. This sequence impedes self-pollination of an individual flower. Flowers are pollinated by insects, hummingbirds, and other pollen and nectar feeders. There is no evidence that wind plays anything but a minor role in eucalypt pollination. The flowers of eucalypts are not highly specialized for insect pollination (HEAR 2007).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;7. Has quickly spreading vegetative structures (rhizomes, roots, etc.) that may root at nodes:&amp;nbsp;No&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Blue gum eucalyptus can sprout from the bole, from stumps of all sizes and ages, from the lignotuber, and from the roots. The lignotuber can live for many years in the soil after stems die back (Esser 1993). This contributes to re-growth, but not spatial spread of the plant. One professional land manager reports that stand spread may arise from root sprouts in addition to seed sprouts (Heath 2014), but this has not been confirmed.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;8.

If the tree is cut down, lignotubers become active and each bud produce a shoot bearing foliage. Such shoots are commonly known as ""sucker growth"" or coppice shoots, and a large number are usually formed. E. globulus resprouts after being burned (Skolmen &amp;amp; Ledig 1990, Bean &amp;amp; Russo 2014).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",&lt;p&gt;See references in text.&lt;/p&gt;,"&lt;p class=""MsoNormal""&gt;&lt;span style=""font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;""&gt;Given the large seed size, there is very little potential for people to accidentally start new populations through unintentional seed &amp;ldquo;hitchhiking&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Annual surveys of retail nurseries around California indicate that few (&amp;lt;1%) nurseries now sell &lt;em&gt;E. globulus&lt;/em&gt; and it has been moved to their &amp;ldquo;retired&amp;rdquo; list of plants because it is so rarely found for sale (PlantRight 2014).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",&lt;p&gt;See references in text.&lt;/p&gt;,"&lt;p&gt;In general, E. globulus seed is not easily dispersed over large distances (Skolmen &amp;amp; Ledig 1990, HEAR 2007, Rejmanek &amp;amp; Richardson 2011).

The Nature Conservancy.","Can be infected with an endophytic fungus that causes illness in livestock and some wild mammals that graze on it. In the mid-South, conversion of idle cropland to tall fescue pasture has degraded wildlife habitat and has been identified as a primary factor for the decline in northern bobwhite populations. Tall fescue stands make travel for many small wildlife species extremely difficult. Difficulty in travel may decrease game bird feeding rates, cause increases in energy expenditure, and possibly in mortality via stress or predation. The thatch it creates reduces food availability for wildlife. The endophytic fungal toxicosis syndromes make tall fescue poor forage for wildlife. Bobwhites on a tall fescue diet exhibit cloacal swelling and increased mortality. In the British Isles, F. arundinacea is never favored by livestock over other pasture grasses. Many animals in North America feed on F. arundinacea. Tall fescue palatability is poor for elk. Reduces habitat, travel corridors, and forage for wildlife. May be a poisoning problem.","DiTomaso, J., E. Healy. Weeds of California and Other Western States. Not yet published.

Emails from Warner, Ruygt and Wrubel (2017) indicate that G. purpureum occasionally outcompetes understory spp. In forests and woodlands. It invades a previously unoccupied niche in bare litter/duff of forests with sparse understory. In brighter locations it outcompetes with native herbs such as Trientalis and Nemophila heterophila and may form > 80% of the ground cover (Ruygt, pers. comm.).","Gluesenkamp, D.

Tofts 2004",G. purpurem can self pollinate as well as cross pollinate.  There is no documentation of it hybridizing with native Geranium species in California.  Only two native California Geranium species -- Geranium bicknellii and Geranium carolinianum -- overlap with the current range of G. purpureum and could potentially hybridize. There are also many more non-native geraniums occurring in these areas (such as G. dissectum) which would be more likely to hybridize with natives and cause population changes.,"Calflora 2016
Tofts 2004","Anecdotal information on G. purpureum establishment and dispersal in California is available. It has become one of the more abundant weeds along roadsides in Sonoma County, especially in urban areas, but also sporadically on lesser traveled rural byways. Trails are not exempt, as I’ve seen populations in many parks and open space areas (locally) spread from along trails to more remote woodlands (Warner pers. comm.). I have seen it in oak woodlands, riparian woodlands and in ruderal settings. It’s a common and difficult garden weed. I have no recollection of it showing up in chaparral (Rugyt, pers. comm.). Based on these observations and on the establishment of other invasive Geranium species such as G. dissectum and G. molle, which are facilitated by disturbance, and G. robertianum which does not require disturbance to establish, the species is given a Moderate rating.","Cal-IPC PAF for G. dissectum, G. molle and G. robertianum.

Seed dispersal distances are short. Seeds use ballistic dispersal over short distances with 50% of seeds landing within 44cm of the parent plant. Tortoises in Spain ingest and defecate seeds and other animals could do the same. Since the diaspores are sticky, attachment to animals could play a role in dispersal.","Herrera 1991

It is also noted as spreading along railroad lines in Germany. There is little information on the habitat types which G. purpureum has invaded outside its native range. Within its native range it occurs on exposed shale near the coast and inland in a variety of habiats, in dry or moist soils in protected and unprotected areas. This indicates that there are probably ecological types in California which it has not yet invaded, based on its native distribution.

The geographical distribution of Geranium purpureum is essentially Mediterranean, although a finger reaches through France to south-western England and southern Ireland while there are populations at elevations up to 7000 ft. in the mountains of eastern Africa and in Macaronesia and the Azores. This species has been introduced into South America where it is found established in comparable climatic conditions on the east and west coasts and even in the Juan Fernandez islands (Baker 1957). It is also noted as currently spreading in Northwestern and Central Europe (Eliáš 2011).

After disturbance, halogeton can become a dominant species in areas void of competing vegetation. Halogeton is problematic following disturbance from overgrazing, construction, agriculture, or fire. Halogeton usually does not become dominant in undisturbed saline-alkaline soils with vigorous competing vegetation. Halogeton can tolerate high saline-sodic soil conditions unlike most summer annual forbs. This adaptability allows halogeton to grow in areas few other plants can tolerate. Halogeton interacts with the regeneration ecology of valuble native perennial half-shrubs found in the Intermountain Region. Halogeton is not competitive with most established perennials (saltgrass, big sagebrush, greasewood, etc.) and aggressive winter annuals (cheatgrass, medusahead, etc.) since it does not produce a large shoot or root system early in the growing season to capitalize on available spring soil moisture (especially in low summer precipitation climates).&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Pavek, Diane S. 1992.

Halogeton can establish following natural disturbances such a fire. Since halogeton is well adapted to saline-sodic soils, it is often on the first ruderal species to establish on these sites following disturbance. Halogeton can also establish on saline-sodic soils that lack vegetation cover due to high soluble salt or sodium accumulation at the soil surface.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Pavek, Diane S. 1992.

Halogeton grows well on disturbed sites in salt desert shrubland and spreads over long distances by wind and human transport.

As such, I suspect that L. duriusculum may be significantly under-reported, at least in the south coast region. Vanderhoff, pers. comm.

In one important reference on L. duriusculum in Carpenteria Marsh (Hubbard and Page 1997) the species was originally referred to as L. ramosissimum and later re-identified as L. duriusculum (Kelch, pers. comm.), so confusion was introduced in the literature when using that reference.",B,Other Published Material,A,Reviewed Scientific Publication,B,Reviewed Scientific Publication,C,Reviewed Scientific Publication,A,Reviewed Scientific Publication,A,Reviewed Scientific Publication,A,Observational,B,Reviewed Scientific Publication,B,Reviewed Scientific Publication,A,Reviewed Scientific Publication,D,Other Published Material,A,Other Published Material,D,Other Published Material,Array,Array,B,3.5,Moderate,,"L. duriusculum has little documentation of abiotic ecosystem impacts. However, Archbald (2011) studied the closely associated L. ramosissimum ssp. provinciale in San Francisco Bay, and found that soil moisture and salinity were decreased in some plots containing the species, but this effect was not present in all study areas. Light reduction would occur in areas with dense cover of L. duriusculum, as was observed in Carpinteria Marsh by Hubbard and Page (1997). Dense growth has also been observed in marshes in Morro Bay and San Diego County (Giessow and Sayers, pers. comms.).","Archbald 2011

Sayers, J. Personal communication.","Invasive sea lavenders (L. ramosissimum, L. duriusculum) have been found in about 50 acres of salt marshes throughout the San Francisco Bay in the high marsh and upland transition zones. In Carpinteria Salt Marsh, L. duriusculum was associated with decreased native plant cover over the course of 1 year, and this was attributed to L. duriusculum's ability to grow when most native plants senesce (Hubbard and Page 1997). In Marin County, L. duriusculum grows with the endangered salt marsh bird's beak (Chloropyron maritimum) and germinates earlier since it is an annual, directly competing with Birds Beak plants (Kerr, pers. comm.).
In the Ocean Beach Salt Marsh, Abundance of the endangered salt marsh bird's beak is decreasing while the invasive sea lavender (Limonium duriusculum) is becoming increasingly more widespread (Goldsberry et al. 2015). 
Studies have shown that when sea lavenders are present the number of native salt tolerant plants decreases. The displacement of native plants such as Pacific swampfire, Marsh jaumea, and Saltgrass leads to changes in ecosystem function. Limonium duriusculum also displaces salt marsh bird's beak, a rare plant in the Morro Bay Estuary that grows in salt marshes just above the tideline, in the same habitat as the invasive sea lavender. Early detection of Limonium duriusculum is necessary to prevent its rapid spread throughout salt marsh habitat in the Morro Bay estuary (Sayers, pers.comm.).","Archbald and Boyer 2014a

If Limonium ramosissimum or Limonium duriusculum replace these native plants, the resulting vegetation structure dominated by short basal rosettes is unlikely to provide effective cover from predators (Archbald and Boyer 2014b).

While they do occur together there have been no studies of the potential hybridization between Limonium species which occur in California. In the Mediterranean region, over 300 endemic Limonium species have evolved, in part because of the high frequency of hybridization between members of the genus (Palacios et al. 2000). Hybridization often results in highly competitive traits and backcrossing could lead to local extirpation of the native L. californicum species, as evidenced by the ongoing Spartina alterniflora x foliosa invasion in the San Francisco Estuary (Archbald 2011).","Archbald 2011

L. ramosissimum at restoration sites indicates that human-mediated dispersal may have played a role in the distributions (Archbald and Boyer 2014b). L. duriusculum has dispersed long distances in Morro Bay (Sayers, pers. comm.) indicating that it is able to disperse into natural marsh long distances without human mediation, probably by seeds floating on water.

Vivrette and Muller 1977","Excluding native plants, possibly altering soil conditions (see Question 1.1). On Santa Barbara Island, crystalline iceplant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, forms large, dense patches and accumulates salt to the extent that all other species are generally excluded. A common associate is another annual iceplant, Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum. This is a serious management problem because only periodically are salt-tolerant shrubs such as Suaeda californica able to establish, if they can overtop the iceplant rapidly enough to overcome the shading effects. Otherwise, the iceplant leads to the extirpation of other plants from the area and then to erosion problems (Halvorson 1992). 

On the Channel Islands, M. nodiflorum is found in bare areas along the coastline extending in 1/4 mile. These sites are known locations of several rare and federally listed Malacothrix species (Knapp, J. pers. comm.).

Ice plant was a primary food item for island foxes (&gt;10% frequency of occurrence in scats) during two seasons on San Clemente, three seasons on San Miguel and all four seasons on San Nicolas. Although these plants are providing a benefit to foxes by increasing the diversity of available food items, these plants also may be excluding native species. Reducing or eliminating these non-native plants probably could be conducted without adverse impacts to foxes, with the exception of San Nicolas. On this island, foxes may be at least partially dependent on these species and any reductions should be conducted gradually and preferably in conjunction with active restoration of native species to provide alternate foods for foxes (Cypher 2010).

They prefer acid, neutral or alkaline soils, but can tolerate nutritionally poor or saline soils. They occur in a range of vegetation communities, including saltmarsh, samphire flats eucalypt woodlands and shrublands, and as with many introduced species, also grow in disturbed sites such as roadsides, rubbish dumps and homestead yards.

Tree tobacco also contains a toxic alkaloid called anabasine which is posionous to livestock and other foraging animals.","Meyers-Rice, B., Randall J. Weed Report: Nicotiana glauca, Tree Tobacco.

The dense patches of litter can increase fuel loads beginning in the spring when plants desiccate. Increased fuel loads can persist for up to two years. Persistent dense litter from annual forbs and grassees is unusual in California, and is common in relatively few weeds in California (such as medusahead).Persistent litter can create dense fuel beds that will promote the spread of fire. Abundant along road edges and adjacent scrub vegetation, likely substantially increasing the risk of fire conveyance from roads into wildlands (Obs: J Giessow, C McDonald, M Chamberland 2020). Persistent dense litter through the fall and winter drastically increases fire risk through the peak Santa Ana winds fire season. This is seen in average to high rainfall years. (Obs: J Giessow). In coastal sage scrub the increase of stinknet fuel can alter the fire regime, which may add to the fuels created by invasive annual grasses that have already altered the fire regime in coastal sage scrub. In comparison, in desert areas where fuels are naturally sparse, stinknet can increase the fire frequency along roadsides as well as in natural areas (Chamberland 2020). This appears to be happening in and around Phoenix, Arizona, but stinknet infestations in the California Desert, as of this writing, are minimal but increasing. Lastly, stinknet seeds exposed to smoke germinate at higher rates than control seeds, suggesting it is fire adapted and may create a positive feedback cycle with frequent fires (San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research, unpublished data).

Oncosiphon may likely reduce nutrient cycling. Large O. pilulifer patches produce litter that is persistent for about 2 years, while patches of annual grasses and native wildflowers have litter that generally persists for one year or less.

It is unknown whether Oncosiphon alters the water cycle, but it likely reduces soil water moisture due to the abundance of biomass produced in patches, especially in sage scrub communities. It has been shown that annual grasses can reduce soil moisture (Wood et al. 2006). If Oncosiphon acts similarly to non-native annual grasses, then it would reduce soil moisture.


",Publications and the internet.,"Stinknet patches form nearly monospecific stands. In years with adequate rainfall, stinknet seedlings can grow at very high densities, at over one plant per square centimeter, or 10,000 per square meter, and continue to grow in dense stands throughout the beginning of the growing season. Stinknet plants produce relatively large amounts of persistent litter, compared to annual grasses or native wildflowers, and stinknet litter can persist for 2 years. This in turn prevents and diminishes the growth of native wildflowers likely creating a positive feedback cycle. Stinknet patches also appear to reduce the vigor and success of native perennial seedlings, some of which do not survive competition with stinknet.","Field observations, personal contacts with scientists and land managers.","Stinknet is not palatable to livestock. The common name comes from Afrikaans, which roughly means stink only, in that the plant only stinks and it is not used as a forage by livestock or native African grazers. Stinknet has a much higher abundance on highly grazed pastures compared to lesser intensively grazed pastures, indicating it is not palatable (Rutherford and Powrie 2010). In California, very few stinknet plants shows signs of herbivore damage in the field. Very few large pollinators (bees, butterflies, beetles, flies) are observed on stinknet even when pollinators are present on nearby native wildflowers. Stinknet produces copious amounts of persistent thatch (Hedrick and McDonald 2020, Chamberland 2020). Stinknet seeds are not consumed by seed foraging rodents (such as kangaroo rats) (C Rodriguez unpub. data.) ",Rutherford and Powrie 2010,There are no native plants in California that are in the same genus as stinknet. The genus is native to Africa. There are also no weeds in California in the same genus. It is unknown if it causes any genetic impacts.,"Jepson eFlora, CalFlora.","Livestock grazing increases the cover and abundance of stinknet in South Africa (Rutherford and Powrie 2010). In South Africa stinknet can also be found in disturbed areas. In California, stinknet quickly invades disturbed areas, including roadsides, burned areas, mowed fields, graded soils, and plowed areas. In western Australia, stinknet is found invading small grain crops and also invades disturbed soils surrounding farms and is also invasive on livestock ranches. In central and southern Arizona, large stinknet patches can be found adjacent to roadsides, disturbed sites, ephemeral drainages, and even in cracks in the sidewalk and street. Stinknet rapidly invades areas after fire, including spreading into annual grasslands, sage scrub, and riparian habitat (Obs: J Giessow, C McDonald). As tree canopy cover increases, the stinknet population can decline, but may still remain in patches where the tree canopy is reduced.","Rutherford and Powrie 2010, Douglas and Nicholson 2019, personal observations","In a series of years with average or above average rainfall in Southern California, stinknet patches can easily double in size in a few years. In metropolitan Phoenix Arizona, stinknet patches dominate large portions of roadsides, where few stinknet plants existed ten to twenty years ago. Small patches easily spread and increase in size in just a few years also creating an abundance of small patches adjacent to main infestations. Stinknet was first found in California in 1981 in Riverside County and in less than 40 years it has spread over 500 miles as measured from east to west.","Personal observations, conversations with land managers. CalFlora, iNaturalist for distribution information ","Stinknet can now be found in large portions of Western Riverside county, where it has created large patches over hundreds of acres. Stinknet is also found in many areas of San Diego County, where land managers are having a difficult time mapping all the new populations that have been found in the past few years. It has also increasing in San Bernardino and Los Angeles Counties. Stinknet has recently been found in the Central Valley and in Santa Barbara, Kern and Ventura Counties. Stinknet is also becoming more abundant in the California Desert especially in the Coachella Valley. Dozens of new stinknet sightings and populations have been found in the past few years in this region. It is also spreading east into central Arizona and southeastern Arizona. It can also be found in a few locations in and near Las Vegas, Nevada and in northern Mexico. 

While there are large patches in California and Arizona, there are areas adjacent to infestations that are not heavily invaded and only have a few isolated plants. There are many isolated plants that have dispersed a long distance that have the potential to increase in size and become large isolated patches. This may change as more plants reproduce in small isolated patches and form large patches.

https://sdmmpgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=be81637fe366455c85c767bcfafc307e","Stinknet is a winter annual. It generally produces one large synchronized blooming event in the late winter through spring, and sometimes a few smaller blooms will occur later depending on rainfall patterns. However, patches with additional soil moisture can continue to reproduce for several months after peak blooming. Plants produce numerous flowers and can produce 3,000-5,000 seeds per plant with large plants producing many more seeds (Douglas and Nicholson 2019). Seeds can survive in the soil for 5 years in Western Australia (Dodd and Lloyd 1988).","Douglas and Nicholson 2019, Dodd and Lloyd 1988","Stinknet seeds easily disperse on clothes, footwear, pets, tools and vehicles. The seeds are tiny (less than 1 mm long) and also disperse as a contaminant of agricultural and construction products and materials. The seeds are also tightly packed into the inflorescence, where they form a globe shape and the infloresence does not easily break apart. It is likely that these inflorescence balls roll on the ground, float downstream or downhill or break off from the plant. They are also carried in brisk winds. The inflorescenses are also picked up and carried in ‘dust devils.’ Once the inflorescence is forcefully hit, it begins to break apart and easily releases its seeds. Once the seeds are released from the inflorescence, the seeds can easily be carried on clothes and footwear because they are tiny. The seeds also appear to float and may be dispersed downhill with rainwater or downstream in a current. Stinknet seeds exposed to water release a viscous, sticky substance that could help them adhere to boots, tires, and animal fur or feathers. (San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research, unpublished data). Many new stinknet patches are found near sites that are disturbed and also have human activity (such as adjacent to parking lots, hiking trails, highway rest stops, gravel stockpiles on roadsides, recently graded roadsides, etc.).

Hedrick and McDonald 2020.","Seeds are tiny so they could stick to birds and mammals which may migrate long distances. A large number of cases of a single or a few plants have been found far (hundreds of yards) from potential human sources (roads, hiking trails) or in areas where human traffic is less frequent (non-public access nature preserves). Birds are not regularly seen foraging on seed heads. Human assisted dispersal is arguably the more likely long-distance dispersal mechanism, as many new long-distance populations are near heavily trafficked sites, roadsides, parking lots, etc. 

Some locations do appear to be farther from human activity. Some new stinknet individuals are found far from roads, trails or where people frequent, so long-distance (miles) dispersal by animals cannot be ruled out. Several patches of stinknet have been found in areas where winds are concentrated or have significant force during large regional wind events, such as during Santa Ana winds. The inflorescences are also picked up and carried in ‘dust devils.’ It is very likely that during strong winds, either in large regional wind events like Santa Ana winds or in 'dust devils', stinknet inflorescences and seeds are picked up and carried long distances. Stinknet seeds appear to float and can be carried downstream. Stinknet seeds are also very likely carried downstream during flooding events, and flash flood events after desert monsoon storms. ",Hedrick and McDonald 2020,"Stinknet is still spreading in California. It is likely expanding its range in South Africa as it is spreading into disturbed areas (such as farms) there. It is also expanding its range in Western Australia. It is currently unknown how far across the Southwestern US it will expand. Since stinknet is a winter annual it should occupy areas with adequate winter and spring moisture. 

Currently stinknet has been found adjacent to the coast, in interior ecosystems, such as chaparral, California sage scrub and annual grasslands, it has also been found in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of California as well as in Arizona and Nevada. As of this writing one population has been found in Santa Clara county near the bay.

It has found above 4000 ft in elevation in Arizona, however it is highly likely it will spread higher than found in its current distribution given time.","Personal observations, CalFlora, iNaturalist, SEINet. ","Stinknet was first discovered in Riverside County in 1981. Within 10 years it had spread beyond a single introduction location and into several patches on adjacent lands. In the 1990's it had spread to San Diego County as well as Maricopa County, Arizona. In all three of these locations where stinknet populations have been spreading for 20 years or more, stinknet is locally widespread and locally abundant forming very large infestations. At these oldest invaded locations stinknet can dominate the herbaceous flora, forming large dense patches while only a few other herbaceous plants are present. 

Stinknet is still spreading in California. It is currently unknown how far across the Southwestern US and what variety of habitats is will invade. Since stinknet is a winter annual it should occupy areas with adequate winter and spring moisture. 

Currently stinknet has been found adjacent to the coast, in interior ecosystems, such as chaparral, California sage scrub and annual grasslands, it has also been found in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of California as well as in Arizona, Nevada and northern Mexico. As of this writing one population has been found in a disturbed site in Santa Clara county near the bay.

After a fire, stinknet has been found to invade a variety of habitats including annual grasslands, sage scrub, chaparral and woodlands. As taller vegetation recovers such as when riparian tree canopy re-grows stinknet abundances may decline in the shade (Obs: J Giessow).

It has found above 4000 ft in elevation in Arizona, in woodland or forested communities, however it is highly likely it will spread higher than found in its current distribution given time.","CalFlora, SEINet, personal observations, Chamberland 2020.","Since its discovery in 1981, stinknet has since spread to 8 counties in California.

Weed Science.","The growth habit is such that it is capable of excluding cattle from heavily infested areas, as well as crowding out native rangeland forage or plants. Scotch thistle is rejected by stock because of the dense spines.  If it is eaten, the spines cause physical damage, particularly around the mouths and eyes of animals as well as effecting the quality of wool. Major reductions in foraging sites. Injurious components, spines, that damage the mouth and gut of native wildlife and livestock.","Draft Action Plan for Scotch Thistle Eradication in Modoc and Lassen Counties, 1994.

Inhabits wet meadows, pastures, small grain fields, dry alfalfa, as well as disturbed areas in open rangeland.  Grows best on the slope between arid rangeland and wet meadows along streams.  Observed to invade undisturbed sage brush areas.  The first mention of Scotch Thistle in CA in the literature is an article by T.C. Fuller in 1958, stating that Modoc County Ag Comm submitted the first sample for identification in 1957.  The major area of infestation at the time in Modoc County was the Hung Estate Ranch which had 500 - 600 acres.  According to that reprt, Scotch thistle was present at that location in 1942.  In 1958, plants were found in Lassen and Lake Counties.  Earliest reference to this plant being in the US is the 5th edition of Grays Manual dated 1878. Infests disturbed and neglected lands.  It prefers sites near ditch banks and rivers, but also infests pastureland, crops, rangeland, and roadsides.","Draft Action Plan for Scotch Thistle Eradication in Modoc and Lassen Counties, 1994.

This PAF was originally written for Pyracantha angustifolia, P. crenulata and P. coccinea.  It has now been split into three species and the information copied into each.  All three PAFs should be updated with current scientific literature and to reflect the fact that P. crenulata and P. coccinea are considered ""waifs"" in the Jepson Manual and their distributions are much less widespread than P. angustifolia which is noted as ""naturalized.""",U,Other Published Material,C,Other Published Material,C,Other Published Material,D,Other Published Material,B,Observational,B,Observational,B,Other Published Material,B,Other Published Material,A,Other Published Material,A,Other Published Material,B,Other Published Material,A,Other Published Material,C,Observational,Array,Array,B,3,Limited,,"None known.

Since russian knapweed produces a deep, extensive root system, the plant likely has significant effects on soil moisture levels especially at deeper depths compared to native grassland ecotypes.  The plant commonly forms monoculture stands and may influence soil erosion and soil infiltration rates compared to native ecotypes.  Russian knapweed is also commonly found in saline/sodic soils and may change soluble salt distributions in the soil profile. Some evidence suggests that it leads to the accumulation of high levels of zinc in the soil surface which can alter the ability for more desirable plants to develop.","Bottoms, R., C.J.Nelson, T.D. Whitson,and J.H. Coutts. 1999.Factors being considered that make russian knapweed a highly competitive plant. Proc. Western Soc. Weed Sci. 52:73","Russian knapweed will commonly form monoculture stands especially in disturbed areas.  In open areas, Russian knapweed often spreads aggressively covering over 12m2 within a two year period. Russian knapweed stands are also very persistent with documented infestations dominating a site for &gt;75 years. Russian knapweed is a strong competitor.  It can grow in saline/sodic conditions and effectively competes for soil moisture and nutrients with several native plants.  Russian knapweed's deep root system allows the plant to mine deep soil moisture that most native grasses and shrub cannot obtain.  Russian knapweed is allelopathic and inhibits the growth of several plants.  Russian knapweed is also unpalatable to most grazers and tends to dominate rangeland and grazed areas.","Carpenter, Alan and Murry, Thomas. 1998.  Acroptilon repens. Element Stewardship abstract.

Personal Observations by Rob Wilson.","The local spread rate of Russian knapweed varies quite a bit from location to location depending on soil type, soil moisture, disturbance, and the existing plant community.  Under favorable conditions, Russian knapweed will spread quite rapidly extending radially in all directions (creeping roots) over 12m2 during a two year period.  Tom Whitson claimed an 11% average increase in Russian knapweed populations in Wyoming.  The BLM estimates an average annual rate of spread of 8% in the northwestern US.","Carpenter, Alan and Murry, Thomas. 1998.  Acroptilon repens. Element Stewardship abstract.

Russian knapweed invades a wide range of ecosystems, plant communties, and soils, but Russian knapweed's rate of spread in California is quite dependent on location and land-use.  Russian knapweed is most invasive on open, distrurbed sites.  It will grow on several soil types, but it spreads and thrives best in arid areas with clay soil.   It reproduces primarily by root and tends spread at alarming rates following soil disturbance.  Russian knapweed populations located in poor growing conditions have remained static with minimal spread, while other infestations growing under optimal conditions have spread at alarming rates.  The rating given in this section is based on the author's estimate of average spread throughout the state.","Carpenter, Alan and Murry, Thomas. 1998.  Acroptilon repens. Element Stewardship abstract.

Saccharum ravennae,,Erianthus ravennae (L.) P.Beauv and subspecies.,ravennagrass; hardy pampas grass; plume grass; canna di Ravenna,2/14/2007,,,,,,,,,,,Peter Warner,20070416,,,,B,Observational,B,Observational,U,Anecdotal,D,Reviewed Scientific Publication,B,Other Published Material,A,Observational,A,Observational,B,Other Published Material,B,Other Published Material,A,Observational,B,Other Published Material,C,Other Published Material,D,Observational,Array,Array,C,2.5,Moderate,Alert,"Alters fire dynamics, accumulates sediment, interferes with sunlight penetration to soil surface, may alter soil moisture &amp; nutrient content; may alter bank and streambed erosion; may encourage flooding. Ravennagrass produces plants that are, in crude morphology, much like jubatagrass.   Ravennagrass can grow on more exposed soil than many other riparian species, and so can add significant biomass to swift streams.  Riparian vegetation generally produces less dry, herbaceous biomass than these large, grassy plants, so the risk of fire can be inferred, much as with Cortaderia spp (Inferred by Firestone and by AZ Working Group's PAF).  Excepting Arundo and Tamarisk, this is one of the largest and most conspiuous species in the upper Cache Creek, and thus provides lots of shade and biomass to those areas it infests.  As a large plant with a vegetatively thick profile, it appears to accumulate sediment and, in the seasonally flooding Capay Valley, accumulate organic matter and thatch filtered from the streamflow (Personal Observations: Firestone 2007, elsewhere: Northam 2005).  The addition of sediment and detritus, combined with the density of infestation and the ability to grow on mid-channel islets or outcrops, suggests that the process may be self perpetuating, and there may be risk of flooding or erosion due to increased stream blockage (Inferred by AZ Working Group on their PAF; see also McLaughlin Reserve drain). 
       While its apparent preference for bare soil lessens its impact on riparian vegetation, as most vegetation stays clear of exposed or scoured areas, it is not constrained to stream channels.  As Ravennagrass is able to establish on stream banks, seeps or other moist areas outside of a streambed, it may be able to impact wetland or riparian vegetation establishment.  Further, it could potentially encourage and protect against erosion -- the former when interfering with stream flow via biomass and accumulated sediment, the latter when growing on a bank or roadcut. 
      Soil moisture and nutrient content inferred by AZ-WIPWG, but apparently speculative.","Observation of reviewer, and inference from impacts of Cortaderia spp.; Personal observations of Arizona pops by F. Northam (Weed Biology Consultant, Tempe, AZ; reported on AZ-WIPWG-PAF);  Similar conclusions reached by AZ-WIPWG.","Change in structure of riparian community;  loss of habitat;  possible plant community impacts via abiotic processes such as fire. Ravennagrass is still emerging as a problem, so many of the impacts are predictive rather than reporting on that which has occurred.  Ravennagrass grows in riparian zones, of which California does not have enough to spare, yet has broad habitat tolerances within that range.  Significant naturalization has been found in Imperial and Yolo counties, a wetland in the Chihuahan desert and the Grand Canyon, so a variety of native plants may be affected.  
      As mentioned in 1.1, ravennagrass provides a large vertical component to the riparian vegetation previously provided largely by cottonwood, tamarisk and arundo, and often not even by them.  At least as observed in Cache Creek (Yolo) it adds significant vertical biomass.  Additionally, in Cache and Canadian River, OK, it appears to also grow in vegetation-free areas in riverbed rocks or sandy washes above waterline, respectively, thus adding a horizontal component to the vegetation addition.  In some areas, it has formed monocultures or near-dominance, severely limiting streamside, stream channel or non-stream moist vegetation sites (e.g. Cache Creek near Yolo County parks; McLaughlin Reserve).   I have no particular reason to believe that ravennagrass will remove soil moisture, as was suggested by AZ-WIPWG, because it is not known to establish without fairly ample water.  Experience in the Grand Canyon suggests ravennagrass is capable of altering plant communities along banks. Capable of growing under the canopy of other riparian plants and/or displacing natives. (Makarick 1999 &amp; 2003). In Canadian River, OK, dense stands are infrequent, but appear to exclude other vegetation when present; more data forthcoming on this instance.","Personal Observation - Firestone;  Personal observations of Arizona pops by F.

Ravennagrass appears to prefer bare soil or similar environments to establish.  As its optimal habitats regularly provide such areas through natural erosion, it will spread without any human-induced disturbance.  It has been observed on inaccessible cliffside seeps and marshy fields (McLaughlin Reserve, Yolo) where no human disturbance was possible.  It can also ""hide"" inside larger vegetation patches, although it generally prefers sandy riverbanks (Makarick 2003).  Will use human disturbance, where useful (e.g. Canal Banks - Hitchcock 1950; Irrigation ditches - Jepson Manual 1993).  Grand Canyon side channels and Bitter Lake NWR, NM are both free from human disturbance, yet invaded (Stevens 1993;  Pers. Comm.

Grand Canyon populations have had at least 16,000 individuals removed in the 18 years since first identified within the park, and is under active management (Makarick 2003).   Stevens describes a 'population explosion' over ~6 years 1987-1992 (Stevens 1993).

Believed to lack the ability to dominate native plant communities. May influence the abundance of later seral species. On a windy ridgetop in WY, grass density was highest where Salsola was most abundant, possibly due to reduced wind speeds or increased snow accumulation. On disturbed sites, invasion by Salsola may facilitate establishment of later seral species like Nassela pulchra by creating a nutrient island of phosphorous, through added oxalate leached from the Salsola canopy. Other compounds may be produced by Salsola that have other effects on the growth of native plants. Removal of Salsola has decreased the growth of native grasses in WY. Salsola can also compete with native grasses for water and nutrients. Salsola can have a significant effect on the dispersal of wind-borne seeds of native plants by slowing wind currents. Infestations can become dense where adult skeletons build up along a barrier (such as a fence). Most studies refer to Salsola as an early seral stage plant, implying that it is easily displaced by later seral stage plants, and therefore causes a lesser impact on overall plant communities. Salsola can have both positive and negative effects on the growth and establishment of native plants. The net effect is yet to be determined. Might rate a ""B"" ranking.","DiTomaso, J., E. Healy.

Birds feed on the seeds in the canopy in winter (when plants remain intact). In one study, adult Uta inornata (the threatened Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard) were associated with spring Salsola, but hatchling U. inornata were negatively associated with living Salsola in summer months (due to predation by adult lizards utilizing the Salsola). The lizards use Salsola for shade, and occasionally glean insects from the plant leaves.  A recent study by Barrows indicates that S. tragus is a positive component of the habitat of the threatened Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard (Uta inornata).  The data presented show that S. tragus is similar in appearance and microhabitat distribution as native species used by U. inornata for shading, though S. tragus does not provide a food source for the lizards, as native species do.

In Oregon, Salvia aethiopis was first found in Lake County in the 1920's.  By 1949, Salvia aethiopis populations in this area had spread to cover 42,240 acres.  By 1954, the estimated size of the infestation had grown to more than 100,000 acres.  Today, the estimated agreage is approximately 1.3 million acres. Salvia populations in Idaho are estimated to be 4,000 acres.  In Colorado, Salvia aethiopis was first reported in 1951 in a pasture.  The population remained small and stable for many years, but it began spreading rapidly in the late 1980's along the foothills highway near Boulder, CO.  The infestation is estimated to have grown into an area of 4 miles. 
In Northeast California, Salvia aethiopis infestations in sagebrush steppe rangeland have been spreading across the landscape at a steady pace for several years, but plant densities within the infestation have remained static and the rate of spread does not seem to be as rapid as reported elsewhere. Salvia aethiopis produces large amounts of seed and seed is easily spread over large distances (tumbleweed).  Under favorable conditions such as recent disturbance, high winds, and wet weather, Salvia aethiopis can spread extremely fast across the landscape.","Roche, Cindy T. and Wilson, Linda M. 1999.

Can form dense infestations when disturbance occurs. Pristine plant communities are generally resistant to ragwort infestation. Micro-disturbances in the soil created by rodent burrows and deer tracks can provide sufficient habitat for ragwort to invade and maintain its presence in less disturbed plant communities. Once established, ragwort can compete with grasses and clover. The dead rosette opens a space for germination of the seeds. Ragwort can dominate in highly disturbed plant communities. In OR, populations of the rare Sidalcea hirtipes increased &gt;40% after ragwort biocontrols were released.  Ragwort has been shown to inhibit seed germination and seedling emergence and growth of Lolium perenne and several legumes through allelopathy. Legumes were more affected by this. However, ragwort may increase productivity among some pasture species. Ragwort acts as a ruderal, colonizing after disturbance and relatively transient during periods of stability. More competitive at the rosette stage. Most literature focuses on the agricultural impacts of ragwort. Little evidence is available to support the idea that it can significantly threaten native plants. Though, it has impacted them in OR, no data was available for CA.","Mitich, LW. 1995.

Dead skeletons remain standing throughout the summer, often along roadways or other human corridors. These skeletons may serve to carry human-ignited fires into neighboring grasslands or shrubs. This could increase fire frequency in some grassland areas. Mostly found in disturbed areas and along roadsides and fencelines. Not very common in wildlands. No mention of increases in fire frequency is made in the literature. My observations are just that.","Personal observation, Brianna Richardson brichardson@cal-ipc.org.","Plants develop large (up to 3 feet in diameter) rosettes that block light to nearby vegetation and suppress germination and growth. Plants can reach 2-3 m in height, and skeletons continue to stand for several months, keeping an area bare of other vegetation. Infestations can be dense and dominate pasture. In nutrient enriched sites (ex. ruderal areas), where S. marianum grows more vigorously (than in un-enriched sites) species diversity can be considerably lower than where S. marianum grows less vigorously.
S. marianum may have a competitively suppressive effect upon companion species other than Avena and Hordeum. S. marianum does not appear to significanty affect growth of Avena sterilis, A. barbata, and H. spontaneum. This suppression is likely due to the rapid growth and large biomass of the S. marianum in nutrient-enriched sites.
In Australia, S. marianum becomes densely established and excludes most other species. Very competitive once established, and can eliminate most other plants by shading and competition for moisture and nutrients.
Often occurs in dense, competitive stands. When densely established, S. marianum can eliminate native and other species. However, disturbance is required for establishment and spread, so most often sites that are dominated by S. marianum will be limited in scale and will not eliminate all neighboring plant communities and species.

Germination is usually after the first rains in October or November, and flowering begins in March or April.  The spear-like grain is armed with a sharp callus and a long spiral awn, which assist soil penetration following wind dispersal of the seeds (Kadman 1990).  Like most annuals, S. capensis also invests most photosynthate into reproduction rather than foliar growth. Aronson et al. (1990) found Desert populations of S. capensis exhibited greater reproductive effort (ratio of diaspores to vegetative biomass) than populations in mediterranean scrub. 
Stipa capensis abundance is influenced by shrubs, similar to that in California deserts.  Sarig et al. (1994) found that the canopy of scattered perennial shrubs in desert regions may support the growth of annual herbaceous grasses.  However, in halophyte environments the high amounts of salt deteriorates the beneficial environment.  The production of Stipa capensis, under the canopy of H. scoparia exceeded the amount it produced in the open interspace.","Kadmon, R.; Shmida, A. 1990.

The longer the community has been invaded by saltcedar the more xeric in nature are the plant species which occupy the understory. Such deposits of salt-encrusted needles can inhibit other species germination. Saltcedar has been blamed for increasing flooding by forming a partial barrier to floodflow, which can cause floodwater to disperse and inundate areas that otherwise would not be flooded. With the invasion of saltcedar there has been an apparent increase in the frequency of fire in riparian ecosystems. Evapotranspiration rates of saltcedar are among the highest of any phreatophyte evaluated in southwestern North America, including native riparian trees. Saltcedar has been reported to contain 41,000 ppm dissolved solids in the guttation sap.",,"Saltcedar replaced two phreatophytic grass species, saltgrass (Distichlis stricta) and alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides) in a southwestern riparian zone. In some areas it makes up 70-80% of the vegetative cover, substantially displacing native vegetation and reducing the value of this critical wetlands complex for wildlife. In one river system, little regeneration of cottonwoods occurred in the past 30-35 years in a saltcedar-infested area. In the lower Colorado River, saltcedar replaced up to 90% of the riparian communities historically dominated by cottonwood-willow forests.  Once established, periodic burning, clearing, and flooding have allowed saltcedar communities to remain young and to form nearly impenetrable thickets. Saltcedar can form stands considerably more dense than naturally occurring riparian vegetation.",,"The majority of birds do not use saltcedar in high proportions compared with native plant communities. Frugivores and insectivores, abundant in native riparian vegetation, almost completely avoid saltcedar. Studies showed that several species had a higher affinity for the cottonwood-willow association, including common flicker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, porcupine and beaver. With the exception of desert woodrat and desert cottontail, no native mammal species are known to feed upon saltcedar.  Then consumed by wildlife, only young growth is utilized. Although certain wildlife species may find saltcedar beneficial to their survival, the encroachment of saltcedar has most certainly altered the native habitat that was apparently of great benefit to wildlife. Although the southwestern willow flycatcher can nest in saltcedar, infestation have a negative impact on most other birds that would normally use the native vegetation.",,None. No native species within the family in North America. Unlikely to cross with any native species.,,"The development of water management programs that severely impact natural river flows has greatly contributed to spread of saltcedar.  These alterations include reservoir and dam construction, river diversions, flow regulations, and irrigation projects. Historically, the flow of these rivers peaked in the late spring and early summer from snowmelt. These changes in channel geometry and streamflow created conditions unfavorable for the regeneration and survival of native riparian species. As a result, rapid colonization and expansion of saltcedar occurred throughout the western river systems.	In addition to altering streamflow, clearing and plowing of floodplains and associated agricultural activity also aided saltcedar colonization during the 1800s.

Both saltcedar and smallflower tamarisk are facultative phreatophytes that can use both surface and groundwater. The presence of numerous trees along riparian corridors or around desert springs can seriously reduce underground water tables and surface water availability, drying up wetlands, and reducing flows.  Roots extract salts from deep soil layers and excrete it from the leaves.  Salt is deposited on the soil surface with the leaf litter. The increased salinity of the upper soil profile inhibits the growth, survival, and recruitment of desirable native vegetation.

Evapotranspiration rates of saltcedar are among the highest of any phreatophyte evaluated in southwestern North America, including native riparian trees. Saltcedar has been reported to contain 41,000 ppm dissolved solids in the guttation sap.",,"Saltcedar replaced two phreatophytic grass species, saltgrass (Distichlis stricta) and alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides) in a southwestern riparian zone. In some areas it makes up 70-80% of the vegetative cover, substantially displacing native vegetation and reducing the value of this critical wetlands complex for wildlife. In one river system, little regeneration of cottonwoods occurred in the past 30-35 years in a saltcedar-infested area. In the lower Colorado River, saltcedar replaced up to 90% of the riparian communities historically dominated by cottonwood-willow forests.  Once established, periodic burning, clearing, and flooding have allowed saltcedar communities to remain young and to form nearly impenetrable thickets. Saltcedar can form stands considerably more dense than naturally occurring riparian vegetation.",,"The majority of birds do not use saltcedar in high proportions compared with native plant communities. Frugivores and insectivores, abundant in native riparian vegetation, almost completely avoid saltcedar. Studies showed that several species had a higher affinity for the cottonwood-willow association, including common flicker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, porcupine and beaver. With the exception of desert woodrat and desert cottontail, no native mammal species are known to feed upon saltcedar.  Then consumed by wildlife, only young growth is utilized. Although certain wildlife species may find saltcedar beneficial to their survival, the encroachment of saltcedar has most certainly altered the native habitat that was apparently of great benefit to wildlife. Although the southwestern willow flycatcher can nest in saltcedar, infestation have a negative impact on most other birds that would normally use the native vegetation.",,None. No native species within the family in North America. Unlikely to cross with any native species.,,"The development of water management programs that severely impact natural river flows has greatly contributed to spread of saltcedar.  These alterations include reservoir and dam construction, river diversions, flow regulations, and irrigation projects. Historically, the flow of these rivers peaked in the late spring and early summer from snowmelt. These changes in channel geometry and streamflow created conditions unfavorable for the regeneration and survival of native riparian species. As a result, rapid colonization and expansion of saltcedar occurred throughout the western river systems.	In addition to altering streamflow, clearing and plowing of floodplains and associated agricultural activity also aided saltcedar colonization during the 1800s. Saltcedar has also been reported to rapidly infest riparian areas exposed to heavy grazing. Once established, seed dispersal and plant fragments can become established in otherwise undisturbed areas. Establishment can occur on disturbed and undisturbed sites, but disturbance can increase the rate of establishment.",,"Doubling rate between 1920 and 1960 without management was about 6 years. Infestations went from 4,000 ha in 1920 to 362,000 ha in 1960. Recent estimates indicate infestations in the southwestern United States to exceed 600,000 ha .","Brotherson, J.D. and D. Field. 1987.

Much of the riparian area in the southwestern US has been occupied by saltcedar and the rate of increase there has slowed down. However, the rate of increase in other areas where it is just becoming established, particularly in more northern regions is probably greater.","Brotherson, J.D. and D. Field. 1987.

Seeds remain viable for several weeks and will germinate on saturated soils or while afloat. It can vegetatively resprout after fire, severe flood, or treatment with herbicides and it is able to accommodate wide variations in soil and mineral gradients in its environment.

This study also found that leaching from T. terrestris shoots of water-soluble substances which strongly inhibited the germination and radicle elongation of most of the associated annual species.

T. terrestris appeared to be spreading locally during drought conditions in Whiskeytown NRA and in Livermore area (Gibson 2015). Since it is a poor competitor and not a prolific seed producer, compared to other noxious weeds, and biocontrol insects are slowing the spread, this question is answered as increasing less rapidly.

Populations at John Muir NHS in Martinez have been stable without management for five years (Wrubel, pers. comm.).

Studies show no evidence of displacement of native algae, but showed that, in Tasmania, Undaria sporophytes established at high densities in plots from which the canopy of native algae was removed.  The weight of evidence overall suggested little impact from Undaria on low shore assemblages, with control-impact contrasts that could plausibly be interpreted as impacts probably reflecting natural causes.  There was no evidence for displacement of the native canopy by Undaria, with planned contrasts of percent cover between the controls and each of the infested sites largely suggesting a ""no impact"" result.  The increased canopy cover resulting from Undaria's infestation could enhance sub-canopy low shore algal populations by providing greater shelter from dessication at low tide, as has been discussed in other studies.","Edgar, G.J., N.S.

Disturbance events important for successful establishment of Undaria at high densities.   In the absence of distrubance to the canopy, stands of native algae resisted development of Undaria sporophytes.  Undaria occurs at high densites only in disturbed habitats, particularly on sea urchin barrens and also on areas of sand-scour at the edge of rocky reffs and on unstable substrata, but it occurs rarely in established native algal commmunities.  The results from the present study highlight the opportunistic nature of Undaria.

Experimental manipulations provided evidence of  fast re-colonization potential of  algae mainly attributable to its efficient reproductive system.  After the laterally biflagellate, haploid spores are released,  typically swim for up to 5-6 h before settling on a firm substrate, where they develop directly into microscopic, filamentous male and female gametophytes.  male gametes fertilize eggs, which then develop in situ into embryonic sporophytes.  A single frond releases an astronomical number of zoospores, which appear to settle randomly.  Probably all fertilized eggs develop into embryonic sporophytes.  If the latter manage to survive grazers, their very rapid growth ensures continued survival unless the spores settle intertidally.","Thornber, C., B. Kinlan, M. Graham, and J. Stachowicz. 2002.

Recenly, Chris McDonald determined that a specimen from Orange County in Newport Bay from 1987 was also V. tubuliflora, moving the introduction date and location to 1987 in Orange County.

The clone of Volutaria that has established at least at the Anza Borrego and Newport colonies are both a naturally uncommon floral morph. This is apparently the same morph that has invaded Chile. However, this morph is uncommon in the native V. tubuliflora range of northern Africa/Mediterranean basin. If all three widely separated California infestations are determined to be the same genotype and also the same as that is in Chile, then it is likely (not certain) that all of the California infestations originated from a single introduction, and dispersed thereafter (Vanderhoff, pers. comm.). I agree the most likely path of Volutaria spread in California is a single introduction and then more local spread out from the first infestation (McDonald, pers. comm.).",U,Anecdotal,B,Observational,D,Observational,D,Reviewed Scientific Publication,A,Observational,A,Observational,A,Observational,A,Reviewed Scientific Publication,A,Observational,A,Observational,C,Observational,B,Other Published Material,D,Other Published Material,Array,Array,C,2.5,Limited,Alert,"Deep taproot may draw down the water table, but no studies have been done to document this.

In Newport there are very few other weeds when the Volutaria canopy is thick (McDonald pers. comm.)."" The population in Chula Vista is dense and appears to have been growing for several years (Giessow, pers. comm.). 

Based upon field observations, this is a very early germinator (Sept. In Newport Beach), but with only one year of experience as a basis. This very early germination is much sooner that the native flora and likely shades and inhibits the native species. This is similar in phenology to adjacent invasive species in these same areas, such as Brassica nigra, Sisymbrium irio and Bromus spp. There is even observed competition among these species. My other comment has to do with possible allelopathic qualities. Phytotoxins and phenols appear to be documented in several species of the closely related Centaurea genus, although a quick search did not reveal any studies of this with Volutaria.

Jepson eFlora","The pathway for establishment of V. tubuliflora in California is unknown. However, where it has been introduced it spreads rapidly in areas prone to seasonal flooding or along roadsides. It is highly likely that if it is introduced elsewhere it will quickly establish, with or without disturbance. In early 2017 a new large population was found in Upper Newport Bay, located about a mile from the infestation discovered in March 2015.

Vanderhoff, R. Personal communication","V. tubuliflora was first thought to be introduced in Borrego Springs in 2010, with a small number of plants observed in 2011, 2012 and 2013. After the monsoonal flooding in summer 2013, almost one thousand plants germinated in the mud left behind by the water. After Borrego Springs finally got some decent winter rain in late 2014, almost ten thousand plants germinated, a factor of ten more plants than were seen one year earlier.  In early 2017 a new large population was found in Upper Newport Bay, located about a mile from the infestation discovered in March 2015. The population contained thousands of plants in some very dense patches, indicating it is not recently established (Vanderhoff, pers. comm.). Recently an herbarium specimen from 1987 from the population in Newport Bay was determined to be V. tubuliflora, moving the introduction date back to that time.  This indicates the rate of spread of the Newport Bay population is perhaps B, increasing less rapidly (Vanderhoff, pers. comm.), however Burger considers the rate of spread as an A for the Newport Bay population. This question is scored as A since the Borrego Springs population is thought to be increasing at that rate.","Harris et al. 2015

The physical structure of the mid to upper intertidal zones is altered where Z. japonica occurs, often forming a dense, sod-like root matrix that may completely cover the substrate surface (Posey 1988). The narrow blades trap fine sediments. Posey (1988) documented that particle size was significantly smaller in Z. japonica patches after six years. Larned (2003) documented changes in nutrient fluxes in Oregon estuaries after invasion by Z. japonica. The data demonstrate that Z. japonica invasions alter water column benthos nutrient fluxes. These alterations may in turn affect pelagic primary production. These impacts are based on studies from Oregon and Washington as not much information is available specifically from California but it seems likely that similar impacts may be occurring in Humboldt Bay (reviewer comment).&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Harrison and Bigley 1982, Larned 2003, Posey 1988, Thom 1990&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Bando (2006) reported that in Washington, Z. japonica is also invading vegetated flats historically dominated by Zostera marina.

Expansion of Z. japonica is characterized by rapid growth and spread during spring and summer (Harrison 1982).

A decrease in the burrowing ghost shrimp (Neotrypaea californiensis) and other large epifauna was found in areas of Z. japonica in Washington (Harrison 1987, Posey 1988). N. californiensis is a favored prey for the long-billed curlew and found in the diets of the marbled godwit and willet (Dr. Nils Wornock, pers. comm., Point Reyes Bird Observatory). As Nanozostera japonica covers mudflats that otherwise lack permanent macrophyte cover, it could reduce the foraging areas needed by shorebirds. The estuaries Z. japonica is invading are important migration and wintering grounds for many birds.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Baldwin and Lovvorn 1994b, CDFG 2009, Danufsky and Colwell 2003, Harrison 1987, Posey 1988, Quammen 1984&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Nanozostera japonica is invading estuaries that contain native Zostera marina, although there is no information on hybridization.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Kirsten Ramey, California Department of Fish and Game, Dean et al. (2008)&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Often invades areas with little or no natural or human disturbance. A study conducted by Bando (2006) did show that Z. japonica displays a positive response to disturbance, which is particularly relevant to its invasion success, as tidal flats are dynamic systems that experience high levels of natural and anthropogenic disturbance, including bioturbation, coastal development, boating, shellfish culture, and in some regions (Washington), invasive smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) control.&lt;/p&gt;",&lt;p&gt;Bando 2006&lt;/p&gt;,"&lt;p&gt;Z. japonica was discovered at the southwest end of Indian Island in Humboldt Bay, Humboldt County, California, in June 2002. In November 2006, Z. japonica was found near the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant in North Humboldt Bay. In March 2007, a fairly substantial population of Z. japonica at the Arcata Marsh, near the boat ramp at the foot of I Street in Arcata, CA, was found. In August 2007, a third new occurrence of Z. japonica growing on intertidal mudflats in Manila, CA, was discovered. On April 28, 2008, a new population of Z. japonica was discovered by a DFG crew in McNulty Slough in the Eel River estuary.

Populations of the plant are expanding. A study by Shafer et al (2008) examined growth and productivity of Z. japonica at several points in its range on the Pacific Coast of North America and concluded that southern populations may be better adapted to warmer conditions than northern populations, suggesting that Z. japonica could expand further south in California.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Kirsten Ramey, California Department of Fish and Game, Shafer et al. 2008&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;It is an annual, overwintering as buried seeds, or a short-lived perennial (Harrison 1982). Z. japonica reproduces vegetatively through rhizomatous cloning and sexually through seed production (Phillips 1984).&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Harrison 1982, Phillips 1984&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Z. japonica likely arrived on the Pacific Coast of North America coincident with the introduction of oysters from Japan as packing material or as seed on oyster shell (Harrison and Bigley 1982). The introduction of Z japonica to Humboldt Bay was NOT likely associated with oyster culture, as oyster larvae imported here come from hatcheries. The method of introduction into Humboldt Bay is unknown. The detection of Z. japonica in Humboldt Bay, California, in June 2002 represents the first time this introduced species has been encountered in California. The method of spread around Humboldt Bay and to McNulty Slough is unknown, however, two locations of invasion have been at small public boat ramps which may suggest that plant material or seeds can be dispersed in mud stuck to boat hulls, boots and gear.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Kirsten Ramey, California Department of Fish and Game, CDFG 2009&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;The widespread and ongoing dispersal, both within and between estuaries, may be aided by waterfowl species such as Brant geese. The Brant diet includes substantial amounts of Z. japonica, suggesting it is likely that the small goose has become a vector for dispersal of the non-native eelgrass. The possibility that Brant are capable of transporting viable Z. japonica seeds in their guts is being further explored by researches at Oregon State University.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Kirsten Ramey, California Department of Fish and Game&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;Z. japonica was first detected in Washington in 1957 (Hitchcock et al. 1969), in British Columbia in 1969 (Harrison and Bigley 1982), and in Oregon in 1975 (Posey 1988).
